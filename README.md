# Machine learning framework for prediction of patient-hospital readmission in US.

The dataset is available in the UCI repository as [Diabetes 130-US hospitals for years 1999-2008 Data Set](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Diabetes+130-US+hospitals+for+years+1999-2008#). 

- The data was collected from 130 hospitals in the U.S. during 10 years(1999-2008)
- Contains 101,766 observations and 50 features, including demographic attributes, diagnostics, medications and hospital outcome.

This project is divided two parts associated with the data preparation and the binary classification.To have a better visualization of the scripts, I suggest to check them in nbviewer: REVISAR QUE SE HAYA ACTUALIZADO MAÃ‘ANA: NOV 1

The final dataset contains 56.195 records and 56 attributes, having the readmission status as the outcome. This dataset consists of hospital admissions that did not result in a patient death or discharge to a hospice. Each encounter corresponds to a unique patient diagnosed with diabetes, although the primary diagnosis may be different.
