# Machine learning framework for prediction of patient-hospital readmission in US.

The dataset is available in the UCI repository as [Diabetes 130-US hospitals for years 1999-2008 Data Set](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Diabetes+130-US+hospitals+for+years+1999-2008#). 

- The data was collected from 130 hospitals in the U.S. during 10 years(1999-2008)
- Contains 101,766 observations and 50 features, including demographic attributes, diagnostics, medications and hospital outcome.

This project is divided two parts associated with the data preparation and the binary classification.To have a better visualization of the scripts, I suggest to check them in nbviewer:

- Binary classification models
